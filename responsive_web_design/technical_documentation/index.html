      <p>
        Hiroshi Yamauchi’s instructions to design a console which would be
        cheaper than the competition resulted in Nintendo deciding to use an
        outdated Central Processing Unit (CPU). Although a 16-bit processor
        would have coped with ease, to keep the price low they decided to use
        a variant of the 8-bit 6502 processor, developed by MOS technology in
        1975. The chip would be sufficient to run the programs but would be
        unable to generate the graphics required so the company decided to use
        a second chip as a dedicated Picture Processing Unit (PPU),
        responsible for calculating and displaying the graphics. Figure 1-4
        shows the top of the motherboard with the CPU and PPU indicated.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ricoh produced an NMOS processor based on the 6502, the 2A03. The chip
        differed from a standard 6502 in that it had the ability to handle
        sound, serving as pAPU (pseudo-Audio Processing Unit) as well as CPU,
        and that it lacked a Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) mode which allowed
        representing each digit using 4 bits. For the purposes of programming,
        the 2A03 uses the same instruction set as the standard 6502 which is
        shown in figure 2-1.
      </p>

      <code>The 6502 is a little endian processor which means that addresses are
          stored in memory least significant byte first, for example the address
          $1234 would be stored in memory as $34 at memory location x and $12 at
          memory location (x + 1).</code>

        <h2>PPU Memory Map</h2>
      </header>

      <ul>
        <li class="main-li">PPU: Picture Processing Unit</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The PPU has its own memory, known as VRAM (Video RAM). Like the CPU,
        the PPU can also address 64 KB of memory although it only has 16 KB of
        physical RAM. The PPU’s memory map is shown in figure 3-1. Again, the
        left hand map shows a simplified version which is elaborated on by the
        right hand map. Due to the difference between physical and logical
        address spaces, any address above $3FFF is wrapped around, making the
        logical memory locations $4000-$FFFF effectively a mirror of locations
        $0000-$3FFF.
      </p>

      <p>
        Reading from and writing to PPU memory can be done by using the I/O
        registers $2006 and $2007 in CPU memory. This is usually done during
        V-Blank at the end of a frame, as it affects addresses used while
        drawing the screen and can therefore corrupt what is displayed.
        However, this effect can be used to produce split screen effects.
      </p>

      <code>Ricoh also supplied the 2C02 to serve as PPU. The PPU’s registers are
          mostly located in the I/O registers section of CPU memory at
          $2000-$2007 and $4014</code>

        <h2>Colour Palette</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        The NES has a colour palette containing 52 colours although there is
        actually room for 64. However, not all of these can be displayed at a
        given time. The NES uses two palettes, each with 16 entries, the image
        palette ($3F00-$3F0F) and the sprite palette ($3F10-$3F1F). The image
        palette shows the colours currently available for background tiles.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sprite palette shows the colours currently available for sprites.
        These palettes do not store the actual colour values but rather the
        index of the colour in the system palette. Since only 64 unique values
        are needed, bits 6 and 7 can be ignored.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li class="main-li">Colours onscreen: 25 out of 52</li>
      </ul>

      <code>The total number of colours onscreen at any time is therefore 25 out
          of 52. Both palettes are also mirrored to $3F20-$3FFF. The colour
          palette is shown in Appendix F.</code>

        <h2>Direct Memory Access</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        When transferring a large amount of data between devices it is
        inefficient to transfer this through the processor. To transfer data
        from CPU memory to sprite memory, for example, takes the following
        steps:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li class="main-li">Load required SPR-RAM address into CPU.</li>
        <li class="main-li">Write required SPR-RAM address to $2003.</li>
        <li class="main-li">Load byte into CPU.</li>
        <li class="main-li">Write byte to $2004.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        When filling the contents of sprite memory, this technique would have
        to be repeated 256 times. Direct Memory Access (DMA) is a technique
        which allows more efficient copying of data from CPU memory to sprite
        memory. Using DMA, the whole of sprite memory can be filled by using a
        single instruction, a write to $4014. The starting address in CPU
        memory is specified by the operand for the write multiplied by $100.
        The 256 bytes starting at this address are copied directly into sprite
        memory without the further involvement of the CPU.
      </p>

        <h2>Sprites on screen</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        Sprites are the characters to draw on the screen. Sprites can be
        either 8x8 pixels or 8x16 pixels. Most characters are composed of
        multiple sprites.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sprite data is stored in the pattern tables while the sprite
        attributes are stored in SPR-RAM. There are a maximum of 64 sprites,
        each of which uses four bytes in SPR-RAM. The bytes work as follows:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li class="main-li">
          Byte 0 - Stores the y-coordinate of the top left of the sprite minus
          1.
        </li>
        <li class="main-li">
          Byte 1 - Index number of the sprite in the pattern tables
        </li>
        <li class="main-li">Byte 2 - Stores the attributes of the sprite.</li>
        <li class="main-li">
          Bits 0-1 - Most significant two bits of the colour.
        </li>
        <li class="main-li">
          Bit 5 - Indicates whether this sprite has priority over the
          background.
        </li>
        <li class="main-li">
          Bit 6 - Indicates whether to flip the sprite horizontally.
        </li>
        <li class="main-li">
          Bit 7 - Indicates whether to flip the sprite vertically.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <code>Sprites can be read or written one at a time by first writing the
          required address to $2003 and then reading or writing $2004.
          Alternatively the whole of SPR-RAM can be written in one DMA operation
          by writing to $4014.</code>
